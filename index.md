# Introduction to CRISP-DM

## What is CRISP-DM?
CRISP-DM (**Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining**) is a widely-used process model for data science and machine learning projects. It provides a structured approach to handling data-related tasks, ensuring consistency and efficiency.

## Phases of CRISP-DM
CRISP-DM consists of six key phases:
1. **Business Understanding** – Define project objectives and requirements.
2. **Data Understanding** – Collect and explore data to identify patterns.
3. **Data Preparation** – Clean and transform data for analysis.
4. **Modeling** – Apply algorithms to create predictive models.
5. **Evaluation** – Assess the performance and reliability of models.
6. **Deployment** – Implement the model for real-world use.

CRISP-DM is highly flexible, allowing teams to iterate and refine their analysis based on insights gained at each stage.
